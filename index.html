            <p style="font-family: courier,s Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:20px; ">Designing and developing a website in 3-7 days is incredibly and purely insane unless you are building static pages for a blueprint website or a temporary website.</p>

            <p>
                <def style="color:yellow ">Web Design</def> is an art just like graphic design and with that being mentioned, designing requires ample time to come up with a carefully curated and crafted, full-blown webpages that will put your business at the frontline this year,
                2019. I usually breakdown a website into phases (functionalities are usually factored in) and assign activities to these phases with allotted time for each activity just before I get down to the actual Development.
            </p>
            <h5 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 35px; color:yellow; text-align:left; ">The Design Phase:</h5>
            <p>This phase entails summing up the entire project work flow into some kind of a lifecycle (if you are familiar with SDLC, Software Development Lifecycle); Activities undertaken at this phase include:<br>
                <br>
                <def style="font-family: courier, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:green; ">
                    <tab> 1. Functional Requirements Collection- Specific Entities to be included on your webpages and all business logic summed up by client.<br>

                             <tab> 2. Building a prototype /A Blueprint (a mock website)- A static set of all required pages to simulate what the actual pages and functionalities should :<br>
                            <tab>  work<br>
                                <tab>  Look-and-feel-Aesthetics, colours and elements,<br>
                                    <tab>  Responsiveness (does the website adapt to Mobile, Laptops and desktop devices screen resolutions)<br>
                                        <tab>  Cross-browser compatibility<br>
                </def>
                I usually provide copies of blueprints for your evaluation and revision before we get down to building the real life product.
